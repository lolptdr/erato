### Erato

With the use of digital signal processing using Ruby, this Rails application uses audio and visual transmogrification to induce vanilla synesthesia. Fun.

But not this kind of transmogrification:

That's just cosplay.

#### Synesthesia
From Wikipedia's entry on [synesthesia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia):

>Synesthesia (also spelled synæsthesia or synaesthesia; from the Ancient Greek σύν syn, "together", and αἴσθησις aisthēsis, "sensation") is a neurological phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway. People who report such experiences are known as synesthetes.


and [Neuroscience for Kids'](https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/syne.html) website:

>The most common form, colored letters and numbers, occurs when someone always sees a certain color in response to a certain letter of the alphabet or number. For example, a synesthete (a person with synesthesia) might see the word "plane" as mint green or the number "4" as dark brown. There are also synesthetes who hear sounds in response to smell, who smell in response to touch, or who feel something in response to sight. Just about any combination of the senses is possible.
